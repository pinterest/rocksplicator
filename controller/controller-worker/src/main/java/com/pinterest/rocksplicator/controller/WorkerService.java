/**
 *
 * The WorkerService contains:
 * (1) A task dispatcher to periodically pull data from MySQL task queue
 * (2) A pool of worker threads executing the tasks
 * To make sure:
 * (1) every worker thread can get task from dispatcher immediately (if there is idle worker thread)
 * (2) there will be no outstanding tasks pending for worker to pick up
 * It internally maintains a semaphore as the number of idle workers. Dispatcher will acquire()
 * the semaphore before getting any task, and will release() only if there is no outstanding
 * task from MySQL task queue. Workers will release() the semaphore whenever the task is executed
 * in afterExecute() hook.
